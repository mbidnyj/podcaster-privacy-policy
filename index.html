    <h1>Privacy Policy for Podcaster</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 21.02.2024</p>

    <h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The Podcaster app is dedicated to protecting your privacy. We do not collect or store any personal data 
        from our users. Our service is designed to provide AI-generated podcasts through the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT API, 
        which is responsible for generating the podcast content based on user-provided topics.
    </p>

    <h2>Collection of Topics</h2>
    <p>
        We collect the topics that users input to create podcasts. This information is used exclusively for the purpose 
        of fine-tuning and adjusting the quality of the podcasts generated. These topics are not associated with any 
        personal data and are not used for any other purpose beyond improving the content generation for our users.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our app utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API as a third-party service to generate podcast content. However, OpenAI 
        does not use the data submitted to the API for any other purpose than to provide the service. We ensure that no 
        personal data is sent to OpenAI or any other third parties through the use of our app.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, we recommend reviewing this page periodically for any changes. 
        We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately 
        after they are posted on this page.
